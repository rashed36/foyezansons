            <p><strong><u>OUR SERVICES</u></strong></p>
            <br>
            <p><a href="{{route('homefronted')}}"><b>Foyez & Sons</b></a> is a garment-buying house that
                 provides fashionable apparel as per buyer’s specifications and requirements, capable of 
                 handling small and large quantity orders with quality assurance and conducting a final inspection
                 on behalf of the buyer.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Supplier Credibility</strong></p>
            <p>
                To ensure quality, quantity, desired weight, construction, and colour, we evaluate the capacity
                and capability of every garment factory. We also check environmental control, safety laws, labour
                practices, and adherence to labour laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                We make sure that our supplier can meet our requirements when it comes to reaching the average
                number of pieces produced as per the buyer’s requirement at a given period of time to meet the
                schedule.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sourcing</strong></p>
            <p>
                Upon placement of orders, we check and control the quality of all garment inputs such as yarn, fabric,
                accessories, labelling, and coordinate the timing of their procurement and its timely delivery.
                <br><br>
                We allow buyers to choose and decide what kind of accessories and labels to use as far as style,
                colour, and design.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sampling</strong></p>
            <p>
                We develop and provide samples as per buyer’s design, fabric quality, weight, shrinkage,
                colour fastness, and specifications to obtain buyer’s approval before heading to production
                through our professional Directors, Merchandisers, and Quality Controllers who always keep
                a close check from sampling to Production until shipment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Quality Control</strong></p>
            <p>
                Our Quality Controllers visit the factory at regular intervals to make sure we meet our
                buyer’s requirements. Our quality control personnel are stationed at all manufacturing
                sites to ensure that all products will meet buyer’s requirements. We always want to deliver
                satisfaction to our customers; we monitor the order from sourcing of raw materials and
                accessories to production and up to the final shipment of goods. We also monitor and
                report the status of the order to the buyer with systematic follow-up on each and every stage.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>
            <p>
                Only approved goods are packed and the buyer is assured of getting quality merchandise.
                Care is also taken to see whether all packing instructions of the buyer are respected.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Shipment/Cargo Handling</strong></p>
            <p>
                All shipping documents are reviewed and verified as to the buyer’s instructions.
                All cargo is handled by reputable logistics and supply chain management companies
                to obtain accurate and precise information regarding ETD and ETA of vessels because 
                time delivery is as important for us as it is to the buyer.
